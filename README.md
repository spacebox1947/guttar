# guttar
Coded for Arduino UNO in 2014. 

Algorithmic piece of junk made out of old iron plumbing pipes, piezo-electric buzzers, and photo-voltaic diodes.
Was displayed two separate times in Edmonton, Albert in 2014 at NextFest and New Music Edmonton.

In retrospect, this is very simple code and not the most flexible composition and it mostly. If Guttar still existed, I'm sure a much more interesting composition would arise.
